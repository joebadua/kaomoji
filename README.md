Japanese emoticon website, using React, & Semantic UI

Kind of like [this](http://japaneseemoticons.me), but the end result will be a lot more _lightweight_, _efficient_, and _easier to navigate_ through categories. 

I associated each emoticon with a button that copies to keyboard (much faster than highlighting and using cmd + c)
